# SkillCreator 3.2 - Ultimate Meta-Skill

Create categorically the best possible Claude Code skills.

---

## Quick Start

Tell me what skill you need:

```
Create a skill for automated code review
```

The skill will be built autonomously with full analysis, verification, and multi-agent review.

---

## When to Use This Skill

Use SkillCreator when you:

- Need to build a new skill for a specific task
- Want to ensure a skill meets quality standards
- Need structured analysis before creating one
- Want multiple review passes before finalization

## Triggers

Claude auto-activates this skill when you ask to:

- `create a skill for {purpose}`
- `build a skill that {does something}`
- `I need a skill to {goal}`
- `design a new skill for {domain}`
- `create a Claude skill for {task}`

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Phase 1: DEEP ANALYSIS                              │
│ • Expand requirements (explicit, implicit, unknown) │
│ • Apply 11 thinking models + Automation Lens        │
│ • Question until no new insights (3 empty rounds)   │
│ • Identify automation/script opportunities          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Phase 2: SPECIFICATION                              │
│ • Generate XML spec with all decisions + WHY        │
│ • Include scripts section (if applicable)           │
│ • Validate timelessness score ≥ 7                   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Phase 3: GENERATION                                 │
│ • Write SKILL.md with fresh context                 │
│ • Generate references/, assets/, and scripts/       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Phase 4: SYNTHESIS PANEL                            │
│ • 3-4 Opus agents review independently              │
│ • Script Agent added when scripts present           │
│ • All agents must approve (unanimous)               │
│ • If rejected → loop back with feedback             │

Production-Ready Agentic Skill
```

**Key principles:**

- Evolution/timelessness is the core lens (score ≥ 7 required)
- Every decision includes WHY
- Zero tolerance for errors
- Autonomous execution at maximum depth
- Scripts enable self-verification and agentic operation

## Skill Structure & Validation

See [references/skill-structure.md](references/skill-structure.md) for:

- Frontmatter requirements and validation
- Directory structure guidelines
- Script organization and patterns
- Validation and packaging workflows

For validation and packaging:

```bash
python scripts/quick_validate.py ~/.claude/skills/my-skill/
python scripts/validate-skill.py ~/.claude/skills/my-skill/
python scripts/package_skill.py ~/.claude/skills/my-skill/ ./dist
```

## Anti-Patterns

| Avoid               | Why                      | Instead                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Duplicate skills    | Bloats registry          | Check existing first        |
| Single trigger      | Hard to discover         | 3-5 varied phrases          |
| No verification     | Can't confirm success    | Measurable outcomes         |
| Over-engineering    | Complexity without value | Start simple                |
| Missing WHY         | Can't evolve             | Document rationale          |
| Invalid frontmatter | Can't package            | Use allowed properties only |

---

## Verification Checklist

After creation:

- [ ] Frontmatter valid (only allowed properties)
- [ ] Name is hyphen-case, ≤64 chars
- [ ] Description ≤1024 chars, no `<` or `>`
- [ ] 3-5 trigger phrases defined
- [ ] Timelessness score ≥ 7
- [ ] `python scripts/quick_validate.py` passes
